This is an auditing solution that focusses on helping organisations keep track of their information assets, manage incident response and disaster recovery documentation so that in the event of an audit, they have a clear evidence trail to demonstrate compliance.


Key Stages
==========

1) determine potential value of a blockchain implementation of this solution
2) determine whether a public or private blockchain deployment would be better
3) develop a central concept to be implemented as a distributed system data model 
4) select appropriate architecture and learn toolsets
5) develop the solution to a proof of concept
6) build a team.
